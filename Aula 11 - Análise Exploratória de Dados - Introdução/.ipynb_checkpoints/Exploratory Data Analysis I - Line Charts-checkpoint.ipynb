    "## 1. Representation of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've mostly been manipulating and working with data that are represented as tables. Microsoft Excel, the pandas library in Python, and the CSV file format for datasets were all developed around this representation. Because a table neatly organizes values into rows and columns, we can easily look up specific values at the intersection of a row value and a column value. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to explore a dataset to uncover patterns when it's represented as a table, especially when that dataset contains many values. We need a different representation of data that can help us identify patterns more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll learn the basics of **data visualization**, a discipline that focuses on the visual representation of data. As humans, our brains have evolved to develop powerful visual processing capabilities. We can quickly find patterns in the visual information we encounter, which was incredibly important from a survivability standpoint. Unfortunately, when data is represented as tables of values, we can't really take advantage of our visual pattern matching capabilities. This is because our ability to quickly process symbolic values (like numbers and words) is very poor. Data visualization focuses on transforming data from table representations visual ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, named **Exploratory Data Analysis**, we'll focus on data visualization techniques to explore datasets and help us uncover patterns. In this mission, we'll use a specific type of data visualization to understand U.S. unemployment data."

    "The **United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** surveys and calculates the monthly unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is the percentage of individuals in the labor force without a job. While unemployment rate isn't perfect, it's a commonly used proxy for the health of the economy. You may have heard politicians and reporters state the unemployment rate when commenting on the economy. You can read more about how the BLS calculates the unemployment rate [here](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm).\n",

Let's instead download the same dataset as a CSV file from the website of the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://www.stlouisfed.org/). We've downloaded the monthly unemployment rate as a CSV from January 1948 to August 2016, saved it as <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">unrate.csv</span>, and made it available in this mission.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can make the following observations from the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1948:\n",
    "    - monthly unemployment rate ranged between **3.4** and **4.0**.\n",
    "    - highest unemployment rate was reached in both March and December.\n",
    "    - lowest unemployment rate was reached in January.\n",
    "- From January to March, unemployment rate trended up.\n",
    "- From March to May, unemployment rate trended down.\n",
    "- From May to August, unemployment rate trended up.\n",
    "- From August to October, unemployment rate trended down.\n",
    "- From October to December, unemployment rate trended up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the table only contained the data from 1948, it didn't take too much time to identify these observations. If we scale up the table to include all 824 rows, it would be very time-consuming and painful to understand. Tables shine at presenting information precisely at the intersection of rows and columns and allow us to perform quick lookups when we know the row and column we're interested in. In addition, problems that involve comparing values between adjacent rows or columns are well suited for tables. Unfortunately, many problems you'll encounter in data science require comparisons that aren't possible with just tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one thing we learned from looking at the monthly unemployment rates for 1948 is that every few months, the unemployment rate switches between trending up and trending down. It's not switching direction every month, however, and this could mean that there's a seasonal effect. <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">Seasonality</span> is when a pattern is observed on a regular, predictable basis for a specific reason. A simple example of seasonality would be a large increase textbook purchases every August every year. Many schools start their terms in August in north hemisphere and this spike in textbook sales is directly linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to first understand if there's any seasonality by comparing the unemployment trends across many years so we can decide if we should investigate it further. The faster we're able to assess our data, the faster we can perform high-level analysis quickly. If we're reliant on just the table to help us figure this out, then we won't be able to perform a high level test quickly. Let's see how a visual representation of the same information can be more helpful than the table representation."

    "## 6. Introduction to matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the line chart, we'll use the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library, which allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- quickly create common plots using high-level functions\n",
    "- extensively tweak plots\n",
    "- create new kinds of plots from the ground up\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you become familiar with matplotlib, we'll focus on the first 2 use cases. When working with commonly used plots in matplotlib, the general workflow is:\n",

    "- create a plot using data\n",
    "- customize the appearance of the plot\n",
    "- display the plot\n",
    "- edit and repeat until satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive style aligns well with the exploratory workflow of data visualization because we're asking questions and creating data visualizations to help us get answers. The pyplot module provides a high-level interface for matplotlib that allows us to quickly create common data plots and perform common tweaks to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pyplot module is commonly imported as <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">plt</span> from <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">matplotlib</span>:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "plt.plot()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we didn't pass in any arguments, the [plot()](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot) function would generate an empty plot with just the axes and ticks and the [show()](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.show) function would display that plot. You'll notice that we didn't assign the plot to a variable and then call a method on the variable to display it. We instead called 2 functions on the pyplot module directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because every time we call a pyplot function, the module maintains and updates the plot internally (also known as state). When we call <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">show()</span>, the plot is displayed and the internal state is destroyed. While this workflow isn't ideal when we're writing functions that create plots on a repeated basis as part of a larger application, it's useful when exploring data.\n",

If you'd like to follow along on your own computer, we recommend installing matplotlib using Anaconda: <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">conda install matplotlib</span>. We recommend working with matplotlib using Jupyter Notebook because it can render the plots in the notebook itself.
